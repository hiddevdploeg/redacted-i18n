All of the strings files for [Redacted](https://itunes.apple.com/app/redacted/id984968384?mt=12&uo=6&at=1l3vmtU&ct=).


## Organization

Each language has its own `.lproj` folder. Inside are several `.strings` files:

| Name                  | Description                                 |
|-----------------------|---------------------------------------------|
| iOS InfoPlist.Strings | Strings used by the system for the iOS app  |
| iOS.Strings           | Strings used in the iOS app                 |
| macOS Description.txt | App Store description for macOS app         |
| macOS Keywords.txt    | App Store keywords for macOS app            |
| macOS.strings         | Strings used in the macOS app               |
| Shared.strings        | Strings used in both the macOS and iOS apps |


## Contributing

If you’d like to contribute a localization, thank you!❤️ Here are some quick tips:

* Make sure you do each file.
* Don't localize comments in the strings files. (They look `/* like this */`.)
* Run the tests to check your work. Simple run `rake` in this directory.
* Open a PR when you’re ready.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:sam@soff.es) if you have any questions about a string's usage or anything else. Thanks again!
