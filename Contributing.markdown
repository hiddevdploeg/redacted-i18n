* Make sure you do each file.
* Don’t localize keys in strings files.
* Don’t localize comments in the strings files. (They look `/* like this */`.)
* Run the tests to check your work. Simple run `rake` in this directory.

Feel free to [email me](mailto:sam@soff.es) if you have any questions about a string’s usage or anything else. Thanks again!
